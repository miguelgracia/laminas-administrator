Version 1.0.0
---------------------------
- Drag & Drop feature
- Updated third-party libraries and plugins
- Implemented plugins system for PHP connector (server-based)
- Implemented AWS S3 storage plugin
- Ability to limit max size of the storage (root folder)
- Optimized for integration with frameworks - added "pluginPath" option to load scripts correctly when using custom path routing
- Extended list of previewed file types via ViewerJS
- Implemented preview of MS Office file types via Google Docs Viewer
- Dropzone file uploader replaced with Blueimp's jQuery-File-Upload, which provides out of the box following features:
    * chunked upload;
    * image resizing (Wideimage lib was removed);
    * image orientation (auto-rotation);
- New design and features in multiple upload window for preview items; controls for each item (start, abort, resume, delete, etc.)
- Improved Filetree: allow to open and display multiple subfolders at a time
- Improved manipulation of Filetree nodes:
    * rewritten most of items manipulation methods to perform all possible operations on client-side;
    * this made possible to significantly reduce number of server requests (which is critical for S3 servers that charge you for each request);
    * implemented "moveNode" for Drag & Drop and "replace" action;
- Implemented "moveNode" for Drag & Drop and "replace" action
- Added new "Type" column in the list view
- Implemented natural sorting on the client-side for Filetree nodes and Fileinfo items after "upload", "add", "rename", "move" and other actions
- Improved list view sorting: sort settings are persistent during folders navigation and not reset as it was before
- Caching result of some requests which were duplicated for Filetree and Fileinfo sections (like "getfolder")
- Reduced number of requests to server by implementing "getFolderData" method that caches data for a short time
- Rewritten most of items manipulation methods to perform all possible operations on client-side, that makes possible
to significantly reduce number of server requests (which is critical for S3 servers that charge you for each request)
- FM template wrapped with ".fm-container" container; CSS rules in all themes were encapsulated to affect only elements inside container
- New transliteration methods on client and server sides (PHP) to support a wide range of chars (cyrillic, chinese, etc.)
- Auto calculating FM height when place it to the non-empty page to fill the empty space (between header and footer, for example)
- Improved FM height calculating (check required for CKEditor and other WYSIWYGs)
- Fixed bug: security vulnerabilities in PHP connector ("getinfo", "rename" and "move" methods)
- Fixed bug: "Parent Folder" button in file preview mode works correctly
- Fixed bug: sorting respects type of item (file/folder) and doesn't mixes them together
- Fixed bug: handle download errors correctly, if any
- Fixed bug: better error handling for client-size and in PHP connector
